    <h3 class="reading-title">FIRST READING
    </h3>
    <h3 class="introduction">A reading from the Book of Deuteronomy
    </h3>
    <h3 class="reading-chapter">(Deuteronomy 34:1-12)
    </h3>
    <p class="reading-body">In those days: Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah,
        which is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan, all Naphtali, the land of
        Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, the Negeb, and the Plain, that is, the
        valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. And the LORD said to him, "This is the land of which I
        swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your
        eyes, but you shall not go over there." So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab,
        according to the word of the LORD, and he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-peor; but
        no man knows the place of his burial to this day. Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye
        was not dim, nor his natural force abated. And the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty
        days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended. And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the
        spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; so the people of Israel obeyed him, and did as the LORD
        had commanded Moses. And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to
        face, none like him for all the signs and the wonders which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to
        Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land, and for all the mighty power and all the great and terrible
        deeds which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.
