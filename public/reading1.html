    <h2 class="reading-no">01. The 3rd old testament reading (First reading) in the Ritual Mass for a wedding.</h2>
    <h3 class="reading-title">801(3) FIRST READING</h3>
    <h3 class="introduction">A reading from the Book of Genesis </h3>
    <h3 class="reading-chapter"></h3>
    <p class="reading-body">In those days: Abraham's servant said to Laban, "I blessed the LORD, the God of my master
        Abraham, who had led me by the right way to take the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son.
        Now then, if you will deal loyally and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to
        the right hand or to the left.
        Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The thing comes from the Lord; we cannot speak to you bad or good. Behold,
        Rebekah is before you, take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master's son, as the Lord has spoken.”
        And they called Rebekah, and said to her, “"Will you go with this man?"”She said, I will go.”
        So they sent away Rebekah their sister and her nurse, and Abraham's servant and his men. And they blessed
        Rebekah, and said to her,
        "Our sister, be the mother of the thousands of ten thousands; and may your descendants possess the gate of those
        who hate them!”
        Then Rebekah and her maids arose, and rode upon the camels and followed the man; thus the servant took Rebekah,
        and went his way.
        Now Isaac had come from Beer-lahai-roi, and was dwelling in the Negeb. And Isaac went out to meditate in the
        field in the evening: and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there were camels coming. And Rebekah
        lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel, and said to the servant,“Who is the man
        yonder, Walking in the feld to meet us?” The servant said, "It is my master." So she took her veil and covered
        herself.
        And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done. Then Isaac brought her into the tent, and took
        Rebekah, and she became his wife: and he loved her.
        So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
