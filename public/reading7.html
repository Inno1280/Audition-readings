    <h2 class="reading-no">07. Thursday of the Octave of Easter</h2>
    <h3 class="reading-title">FIRST READING
    </h3>
    <h3 class="introduction">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles
    </h3>
    <h3 class="reading-chapter">(Acts 3:11-26)
    </h3>
    <p class="reading-body">In those days: While the lame man who had been cured clung to Peter and John, all the people
        ran together to them in the portico called Solomon’s, astounded. And when Peter saw it he addressed the people,
        “Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we had
        made him walk? The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant
        Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. But you
        denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, and killed the Author of life,
        whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. And his name, by faith in his name, has made this man
        strong whom you see and know; and the faith which is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the
        presence of you all. “And now, brethren, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. But what
        God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled. Repent
        therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the
        presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, whom heaven must receive until
        the time for establishing all that God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old. Moses said, ‘The
        Lord God will raise up for you a prophet from your brethren as he raised me up. You shall listen to him in
        whatever he tells you. And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed
        from the people.’ And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came afterwards, also
        proclaimed these days. You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God gave to your fathers,
        saying to Abraham, ‘And in your posterity shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’ God, having raised up
        his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you in turning every one of you from your wickedness.”
