    <h3 class="reading-title">FIRST READING
    </h3>
    <h3 class="introduction">A reading from the Book of Numbers
    </h3>
    <h3 class="reading-chapter">(Numbers 20:1-13)
    </h3>
    <p class="reading-body">In those days: The sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin
        in the first month, and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. Now there was
        no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. And the
        people contended with Moses, and said, "Would that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD! Why have
        you brought the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness, that we should die here, both we and our cattle? And
        why have you made us come up out of Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? It is no place for grain, or figs, or
        vines, or pomegranates; and there is no water to drink." Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the
        assembly to the door of the tent of meeting, and fell on their faces. And the glory of the LORD appeared to
        them, and the Lord said to Moses, "Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and
        tell the rock before their eyes to yield its water, so you shall bring water out of the rock for them, so you
        shall give drink to the congregation and their cattle." And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he
        commanded him. And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, "Hear
        now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?" And Moses lifted up his hand and struck
        the rock with his rod twice; and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle. And
        the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the sons of
        Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them." These are the waters
        of Meribah, where the sons of Israel contended with the LORD, and he showed himself holy among them.
