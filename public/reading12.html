    <h3 class="reading-title">FIRST READING
    </h3>
    <h3 class="introduction">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles
    </h3>
    <h3 class="reading-chapter">(Acts 21-11)
    </h3>
    <p class="reading-body">When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. And suddenly a
        sound came from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And
        there appeared to them tongues as of fire, distributed and resting on each one of them. And they were all filled
        with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. Now there were
        dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven. And at this sound the multitude came
        together, and they were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. And they were
        amazed and wondered, saying, "Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of
        us in his own native language? Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and
        Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and
        visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians, we hear them telling in our own tongues the
        mighty works of God."
