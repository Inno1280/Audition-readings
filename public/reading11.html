    </h3>
    <h3 class="introduction">A reading from the Book of Job
    </h3>
    <h3 class="reading-chapter">(Job 1:6-22)
    </h3>
    <p class="reading-body">There was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan
        also came among them. The LORD said to Satan, "From where have you come?" Satan answer the LORD, "From going
        back and forth on the earth, and from walking up and down on it." And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you
        considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God
        and turns away from evil?" Then Satan answered the LORD, "Does Job fear God for nothing? Have you not put a
        hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and
        his possessions have increased in the land. But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will
        curse you to your face." And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power; only upon
        himself do not put forth your hand." So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD. Now there was a day when
        his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house; and there came a messenger
        to Job, and said, "The oxen were ploughing and the donkeys feeding beside them; and the Sabeans fell upon them
        and took them, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you." While he
        was yet speaking, there came another, and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burnt up the sheep and the
        servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you." While he was yet speaking, there came
        another, and said, "The Chaldeans formed three companies, and made a raid upon the camels and took them, and
        slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you." While he was yet speaking,
        there came another, and said, "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's
        house; and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it
        fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you." Then Job arose, and tore
        his robe, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshipped. And he said, "Naked I came from my
        mother's womb, and naked shall I return; the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the
        LORD." In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.
