    <h3 class="introduction">A reading from the first Book of Kings
    </h3>
    <h3 class="reading-chapter">(1 Kings17:10-16)
    </h3>
    <p class="reading-body">In those days: Elijah [the prophet] arose and went to Zarephath, and when he came to the
        gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks; and he called to her and said, "Bring me a little
        water in a vessel, that I may drink." And as she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, "Bring me a
        morsel of bread in your hand." And she said. "As the LORD your God lives. I have nothing baked, only a handful
        of meal in a jar, and a little oil in a pitcher, and now, I am gathering a couple of sticks, that I may go in
        and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it, and die." And Elijah said to her, "Fear not; go and do
        as you have said; but first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterward make for yourself and
        your son. For thus says the LORD the God of Israel, "The jar of meal shall not be spent, and the pitcher of oil
        shall not fail, until the day that the LORD sends rain upon the earth." And she went and did as Elijah said; and
        she, and he, and her household ate for many days. The jar of meal was not spent, neither did the pitcher of oil
        fail, according to the word of the LORD which he spoke by Elijah.
