    <h2 class="reading-no">05. The First reading for the memorial of St. Charles Lwanga (June 3)</h2>
    <h3 class="reading-title">FIRST READING
    </h3>
    <h3 class="introduction">A reading from the Second Book of Maccabees
    </h3>
    <h3 class="reading-chapter">(2 Maccabees 7:1-2.9-14)
    </h3>
    <p class="reading-body">In those days: It happened that seven brothers and their mother were arrested and were being
        compelled by the king, under torture with whips and cords, to partake of unlawful swine's flesh. One of them,
        acting as their spokesman, said, "What do you intend to ask and learn from us? For we are ready to die rather
        than transgress the laws of our fathers." And when [the second brother] was al his last breath, he said, "You
        accursed wretch, you dismiss us from this present life, but the King of the universe will raise us up to an
        everlasting renewal of life, because we have died for his laws." After him, the third was the victim of their
        sport. When it was demanded, he quickly put out his tongue and courageously stretched forth his hands, and said
        nobly, "I got these from Heaven, and because of his laws I disdain them, and from him I hope to get them back
        again." As a result the king himself and those with him were astonished at the young man's spirit, for he
        regarded his sufferings as nothing. When he too had died, they maltreated and tortured the fourth in the same
        way. And when he was near death, he said, "One cannot but choose to die at the hands of men and to cherish the
        hope that God gives of being raised again by him. But for you there will be no resurrection to life!"
    </p>
