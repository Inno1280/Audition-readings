    <h3 class="reading-title">FIRST READING
    </h3>
    <h3 class="introduction">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles
    </h3>
    <h3 class="reading-chapter">(Acts 9:31-42)
    </h3>
    <p class="reading-body">In those days: The Church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was
        built up; and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit it was multiplied. Now as
        Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints that lived at Lydda. There he found a
        man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed. And Peter said to him, "Aeneas,
        Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed." And immediately he rose. And all the residents of Lydda and
        Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord. Now there was at Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which means Dorcas
        or Gazelle. She was full of good works and acts of charity. In those days she fell sick and died; and when they
        had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter
        was there, sent two men to him entreating him, "Please come to us without delay." So Peter rose and went with
        them. And when he had come, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping, and
        showing coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them. But Peter put them all outside and knelt
        down and prayed; then turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, rise." And she opened her eyes, and when she saw
        Peter she sat up. And he gave her his hand and lifted her up. Then calling the saints and widows he presented
        her alive. And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
