        Year
        C</h2>
    <h3 class="reading-title">FIRST READING
    </h3>
    <h3 class="introduction">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles
    </h3>
    <h3 class="reading-chapter">(Acts 1: 1- 11)
    </h3>
    <p class="reading-body">In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach,
        until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom
        he had chosen. To them he presented himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing to them during
        forty days, and speaking of the kingdom of God. And while staying with them he charged them not to depart from
        Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, “you heard from me, for John baptised with
        water, but before many days you shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit.” So when they had come together, they
        asked him, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?” He said to them, “It is not for you to
        know times or seasons which the Father has fixed by his own authority. But you shall receive power when the Holy
        Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end
        of the earth.” And when he had said this, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of
        their sight. And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes,
        and said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into
        heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”
