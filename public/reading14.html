    <h2 class="reading-no">14. The Epistle (Reading from the New Testament) for the Easter Vigil Mass.</h2>
    <h3 class="reading-title">EPISTLE
    </h3>
    <h3 class="introduction">A reading from the Letter of Saint Paul to the Romans
    </h3>
    <h3 class="reading-chapter">(Romans 6:3-11)
    </h3>
    <p class="reading-body">Brethren: All of us who have been baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death.
        We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory
        of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we
        shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our former man was crucified with
        him so that the sinful body might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin. For he who has died
        is freed from sin. But if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. For we know
        that Christ being raised from the dead will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. The death he
        died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves
        dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
    </p>
