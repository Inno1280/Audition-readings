    <h2 class="reading-no">20. First Reading for the Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul (Jan 25) </h2>
    <h3 class="reading-title">FIRST READING
    </h3>
    <h3 class="introduction">A reading from the Acts of the Apostles
    </h3>
    <h3 class="reading-chapter">(Acts 22:3-16)
    </h3>
    <p class="reading-body">In those days: Paul said to the people [in Jerusalem], “I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in
        Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, educated according to the strict manner of the law
        of our fathers, being zealous for God as you all are this day. I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and
        delivering to prison both men and women, as the high priest and the whole council of elders bear me witness.
        From them I received letters to the brethren, and I journeyed to Damascus to take those also who were there and
        bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished. As I made my journey and drew near to Damascus, about noon a
        great light from heaven suddenly shone about me. And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul,
        Saul, why do you persecute me?’ And I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth
        whom you are persecuting.’ Now those who were with me saw the light but did not hear the voice of the one who
        was speaking to me. And I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Rise, and go into Damascus,
        and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.’ And when I could not see because of the
        brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus. And one
        Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there, came to me, and
        standing by me said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight.’ And in that very hour I received my sight and saw
        him. And he said, ‘The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Just One and to hear a
        voice from his mouth; for you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard. And now why
        do you wait? Rise and be baptised, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.”’
